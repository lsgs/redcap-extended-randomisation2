********************************************************************************
## Summary

REDCap external module building on the "Randomization 2.0" features incorporated from v14.7.0 to provide:

* Alternative randomization algorithms beyond REDCap's built-in stratified permuted block randomization (via the `redcap_randomize_record()` hook)
* Batch randomization for randomizing multiple records in sequence

Enable randomization for your project and configure extended options on the Randomization Setup page:

* Biased coin minimization with customizable stratum weightings and allocation ratios
* Random integer in specified range
* Random floating point number 0-1
* Random group selection

Configuration options available using the "Configure" button on the External Modules page include:

* Batch randomization (Development status): select multiple records to randomise sequentially in a batch (e.g. for simulations or cluster randomisation)
* Specify a seed for random number generation (for reproducibility)
* *Admin must enable* Batch randomization (Production status): select multiple records to randomise sequentially in a batch e.g. for cluster randomized trials

## Configuration: External Module Settings
### Recipient for error alert email (optional)
Specify one or more email addresses for people to be notified of any exceptions thrown by the module.

### Enable batch randomization (Development)
(Automatically enabled.)

Adds new "Batch Randomization" tab to Randomization page for users with both "Dashboard" and "Randomize" permissions.

The page will display a list of records in the project that are in a state suitable for being randomized for the current randomization model, i.e. have all releavant stratification factors set, and have not already been randomized. Select a field to sort by (default is record id) and the records to randomize and they will be randomized in sequence. Charts by group for allocaitons overall and for each stratum will be updated dynamically as the process executes and the records randomized.

### Seed for reproducible random number generation (integer, optional)
Specify an integer seed value for the module's random number generator in the project. This fixes the sequence of pseudo-random numbers so that the sequence is reproducible. 

**DO NOT EDIT the seed value once randomizations have commenced**.

### Seed sequence (positive integer)
A counter incremented each time the module generates a random number within the project. Specifies the current location in the sequence of pseudo-random numbers corresponding to the specified seed value.

**DO NOT EDIT the seed sequence** except to delete value or reset to 0 after erasing all project data (although this should happen automaticaly).

### Delay module execution
Unlikely to be necessary, but this option can be checked to have this module executed for each hook as late as possible in the sequence of modules implementing the `redcap_randomize_record()` hook.

## Configuration: Algorithm Options
### Default
Utilize the regular procedure of selecting the next available allocation table entry when randomizing. Not all randomization models in a project need to use one of the alternative algorithms. You may just want to utilize the "Batch Randomization" page, for example, or have one randomization model using (for example) the "Biased coin minimization" option, but a second randomization model in the project use the regular sequential allocation from a stratified list.

### Biased Coin Minimization
Dynamic randomization via the biased coin minimization algorithm with customizable strata weighting and group allocation ratios as described in this paper:
> Han, B., Enas, N. H., & McEntegart, D. (2009). Randomization by minimization for unbalanced treatment allocation. *Statistics in medicine, 28*(27), 3329â€“3346. [https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3710](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3710)

*Options:*
* **Stratification factor weighting**: for each stratification factor specify its relative importance to the minimization calculation. Weighting values must be greater than zero and sum to 1.
* **Group allocation ratio**: 
 * Open allocation: select the allocation ratio for each group. Options are integers 0-10 (and may not all be 0!).
 * Concealed allocation: specify an array of groups/ratios in JSON format, e.g.<br>
 `[{"group":"A","ratio":1},{"group":"B","ratio":1}]`
* **Base assignment probability**: the probability (0-1) that the group calculated to minimize the allocation imbalance will actually be assigned to the randomized record. Typically around 0.7. (0 would mean the preferred group would *never* be assigned; 1 would mean the preferred group would *always* be assigned.)
* **Logging field**: select a notes-type field from the target event into which full logging of the minimization and assignment calculations will be recorded.

**Note**: Settings for strata weightings, allocation ratios, and base allocation probability are editable in Production status only when no records have yet been randomized using the randomization model.

*Allocation Behaviour:*
* **Open group allocation**: The next available allocation table entry will have its target field (group) updated with the result of the minimization algorithm.
* **Concealed allocation**: The result of the minimization algorithm will be recorded to the alternate target column in the allocation table.

### Random Integer in Specified Range
Generates a random integer between the specified minimum and maximum values (inclusive).

*Options:*
* **Min**: minimum integer value of range
* **Max**: maximum integer value of range

*Allocation Behaviour:*
* **Open group allocation**: Regular group allocation, with the random integer recorded as the randomization number and available via the `[rand-number]` smart variable.
* **Concealed allocation**: The random integer is recorded as the target randomization value, overwriting whatever value was originally uploaded for the entry in the allocation table.

### Random Floating Point Number 0-1
Generates a random floating point number between 0 and 1.

*Allocation Behaviour:*
* **Open group allocation**: Regular group allocation, with the random number recorded as the randomization number and available via the `[rand-number]` smart variable.
* **Concealed allocation**: The random number is recorded as the target randomization value, overwriting whatever value was originally uploaded for the entry in the allocation table.

### Random Group
Rather than selecting the next available entry from the allocation table in sequence, the record will be assigned to an available allocation table entry at random.

*Allocation Behaviour:*
* **Open group allocation**: Record assigned to random allocation table entry for stratum
* **Concealed allocation**: *Not available*
