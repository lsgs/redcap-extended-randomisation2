abstract: >-
  REDCap external module providing a framework for
  alternative randomization algorithms that extend beyond
  REDCap's built-in capabilities for stratified permuted
  block randomization. 


  The module contains some simple random number generation
  algorithms, plus an implementation of a dynamic biased
  coin minimization algorithm with facility for customizable
  stratum weightings and allocation ratios. The algorithm is
  based on the model described in the following article:
